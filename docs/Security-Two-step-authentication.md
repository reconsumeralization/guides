## How to enable the two-step authentication on your profile:

1.  Login to your  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **[Edit Profile](Profile-edit-users-profile.md)**.
3.  If you don’t have  **Google Authenticator**  app installed on your mobile phone, you can choose  **Android**  or  **iOS**  below to get one.

6. Once the QR code is scanned, you will see the account created with a verification code. (There’s no need to write down or memorize the verification code because it changes every 30 seconds.)
7. Now you will be redirected to enter the verification code and press “Send”. If the code is valid 2 Step Authentication will be enabled, otherwise you will have to scan QR code and enter the verification code again.
