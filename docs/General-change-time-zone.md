# How to change Time Zone 🌐


It is important to have your Time Zone correctly set up. For example, ads, orders, reviews, topics and replies on forum, blog posts etc, will not display the date or time you expect to if you don’t have the correct timezone set in your website.

To change the Time Zone, follow these steps:

1. Login to your **Admin Panel** -> **Settings**  ->  **General**.
2.  In the  _Regional Configuration_  section,  **Time Zone**  field, select your city or the city with the same timezone as yours.
3.  Click  **Save**.
