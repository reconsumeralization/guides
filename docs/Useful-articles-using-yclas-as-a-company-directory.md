The basic features provided by this free classifieds script are enough to get on with a good looking free or paid business directory.

## Location Based Listings

Locations form is inseparable when building a business directory. 
A location based category not only saves time by directing the user to the services available in their area, but also makes it easy to get rid of any extra fields in your business listings. 

Yclas does not only allow you to add multiple locations but it allows you to add multiple sub-locations under a single location. This means that you can break down your website in many smaller parts depending on the locations that exist geographically.

## Paid Listings

One of the major reasons for using our free classifieds script is that Yclas allows you to charge your users a specific amount of money for posting adverts in selected categories or in all categories. This allows you to start a paid directory or provide premium listings in free business directories.

## Custom Fields

Yclas already has fields to enter general details of the businesses/services including name, email and phone number.

## Unlimited Categories

We understand that there are countless businesses that can be listed in a business directory and within each category there can be hundreds of small or sub-categories. Thatâ€™s why Yclas allows you to create unlimited categories and sub-categories. Each of these categories can be either created for free, or it can be paid, depending on your specific idea and need.
