Now sellers can publish an event date to their ads and sell tickets. With this feature, users can sort listings by event date, and a Calendar view is available and buy a ticketed event.

## How it works

-   Seller selects an event date posting his ad.
-   Buyer clicks the Buy Now button and buys a ticketed event.
-   The confirmation email is sent to the buyer, which includes the Order ID and Product ID.

## Prerequisites

-   **Buy Now button** has to be activated.
-  **Stock Control** has to be activated.
-   **Event date custom field** has to be created.
-   Seller selects the event date while posting the ad.

## Create the Event Date field

1.  Create a Custom Field on  **Classifieds -> Custom Fields -> New**.
2.  The custom field  _Name_  must be  **eventdate**  and  _Type_  must be  **Date**.

Done! You can now go to the Publish new page to see the result and your users can select a calendar view.
