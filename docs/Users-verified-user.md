# Verified User

This  feature allows admins and moderators to mark a user account as verified. 
A verified user would be considerate a more trustworthy user. Once a user is verified, a badge is displayed next to their username. It can be viewed in the users ad pages, their profile and listing page.

Follow these steps to verify a user:

1.  Login to your **Admin panel**.
2.  Create a new custom field named " **verifiedbadge** "  ( [How to create a custom field](Custom-fields-create-custom-fields.md)  )
3.  Go to **Configure -> Settings - > Custom Fields**  ->  **New Field**.
4.  Enter  **verifiedbadge** as the new field's name, choose  **Checkbox** as a type  and tick the  **Searchable** option.  You have to fill the fields Label and Tooltip and press  **Save**.
