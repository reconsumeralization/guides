# How to manage orders

Yclas gives you the option to  **_view_**  and  **_edit_**  the orders made in your website.

When orders placed by users, they will appear on  the **Admin Panel**. From there, you can click on **Classifieds**  then go to ->  **Orders**.  _Note that only the administrator of the website has access to that area!_

Here, you can view the orders made in your website as well as their details:  **_Status_**, **_Product_**,  **_Amount_**,  **_User_**  (who placed this order, username - email),  _Ad_,  _Date_  (date created),  _Date Paid_.

You can also edit these details by clicking on the button displayed below:

Next to the **Edit** button, you have the options to **Mark as paid** or **See order**. 

If you click on the the **Mark as paid** button the **Status** of order will change to **1** ( 1 = paid order). 
If you click on the **See order** button, you'll be redirected to the checkout page.
