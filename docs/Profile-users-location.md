# Add location for users

The location for **users** is a feature that allows you to show the location of a user on a map in the profile page. This way, sellers can display their location and attract more local customers.

## Prerequisites

1.  On  **Settings -> Advertisement -> Display Option**, enable  **Google Maps in Ad and Profile page**.
2.  The user needs to edit his profile, fill the address field and click  **Update**.

## How it works

The user enters his address into his profile and a static map is automatically displayed as an image in the user profile page. Below the map, thereâ€™s an option that allow your website to show the location of the user in a map view.
