# How to create custom fields for users


For example, if you create a **Custom Field** and name it **“Age”**, on the user registration form, a new field named **“Age”** will appear, so your users will have to provide their age when they register.
Other ideas :  **_birthday_**,  **_province_**,  **_phone number_**,  **_address_**,  etc...

## Tricks

1. **PayPal email for sellers->**  Create this user Custom Field so on the user registration form, users will see this new field to enter their  **PayPal account email address**  that will be used to get paid from their ads, if a different PayPal email address is not set in the advertisement. For more information follow  [this guide](Custom-fields-PayPal-email-for-users.md).
    
2. **Chat with the seller->**  Using this option in your site users can enter their **Whatsapp** phone number, **Skype** Id and **Telegram** username into their user profile account. 

This way users will be able to contact sellers directly just by clicking on the icon of the service  **Whatsapp**,  **Skype**  or  **Telegram**.  [Here](Users-chat-with-sellers.md)  are the instructions to follow to enable this feature.
    
3.  **Verified User->**  The admins and moderators of the site have the option to mark a trustworthy user as verified. Verified users will get a verified badge next to their username. More information  [here](Users-verified-user.md).
