# How to force registration before posting a new ad?

We werenâ€™t in favor of adding this feature to the software, but after many requests we decided to release it with our Yclas 2.1.8 . Now you are able to force your users to register before they post any ad on your website.

**To enable this feature you can follow these simple steps:**

1.  Log into your  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **Settings**  >  **Advertisement**  >  **Publish Options**.
3.  Set  **Require login to post**  value to  **ON**.
4.  Click  **Save**.

We found that the most convenient style for a theme with this feature is the **[Newspaper theme](https://yclas.com/domain/demo/105540?theme=newspaper)**.
