## Why you should use Google Analytics

Itâ€™s useful to use  [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/)  (GA) on your website for several reasons.

First of all, GA is the best because itâ€™s free and itâ€™s giving you much more data (who and when visits your site, etc) than any other free analytics software.

Secondly, GA makes it easy for anyone managing a site to track and analyze these data. Its custom reports allow you to see your data the way you need to see it, whenever you need it.

Lastly, everybody trusts Google Analytics data. Currently, around 55% of 10,000 most popular websites are using it and it's in  49.95% of the top 1,000,000 websites.
