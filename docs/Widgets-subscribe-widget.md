An Example: A user visits your site and choose to subscribe to the categories “Apartment” and “House”, in “Barcelona”, in a price range of 0-400.000. 
When a new advertisement is published to the website, on the category “Apartment” or “House”, in “Barcelona” with a price between 0 and 400.000, user will get an  [automatic email](Content-automatic-email.md)(ads-subscribers) about the ad.
