# How to configure ElasticEmail with Yclas?


### How it works

Follow these simple steps to integrate ElasticEmail into your website:

1.  Set up an  **[ElasticEmail](https://j.mp/elasticemailoc)**  account.
2.  Go to your ElasticEmail account https://elasticemail.com/account#/settings -> SMTP/API and copy the  **API Key**.
3. Go to your website's admin panel,  **Configure**  ->  **Integrations**  ->  **ElasticEmail** then paste the   **API Key**.
4.  Enter the  **List name to subscribe users after register**  that you want users to be automatically subscribed after they register. ElasticEmail provides technical instructions on  [how you can create a list](https://api.elasticemail.com/public/help#List_Add).
5.  Click  **Save**.

Now, every e-mail you send using the admin panel will be sent through your ElasticEmail account.
