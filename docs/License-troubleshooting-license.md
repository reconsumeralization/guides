# Troubleshooting license error of child theme activation

One common error that users face is related to the license of their child theme. If you are trying to activate your child theme but you are getting an error indicating that your license number is already in use, then you need to  **follow the instructions below**:

1.  **Backup**  your website  **files and database**.
2.  Login into your hosting  **cPanel**, go to your  **Database**, table oc2_config,  **find and delete**  the entry with “group_name” = “theme” and “config_key” = “_your premium theme name_”, if exists.
3.  **Find**  the entry with config_key =  _theme_  and  **change**  config_value to  _default_.
4.  Go into your  **cPanel File Manager**  and delete everything inside oc/cache/
5.  Login into your admin panel and activate your theme.
