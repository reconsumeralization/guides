-  Available options

When you buy  **[Yclas Self Hosted PRO](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html),**  you can enjoy plenty of additional options that help you to adjust the page to your needs. You can manage them by going to  **Panel**  and choose  **Theme options**  (note, that this tab is only visible, if you’re currently using a premium theme).

*Note: Depending on the active theme some of the options are available. The "Default theme" has fewer options than the listed below*
