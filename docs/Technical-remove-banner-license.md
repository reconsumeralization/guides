# Remove licence or banner


Yclas Self-hosted is an  **Open Source**  script. You are allowed to use our software  **completely free**. The only thing we ask from you in return is to give us a recognition for our work and to  **keep  the license information in the footer**  - we kindly ask you to keep the following information:

The only way to remove this caption is to get a  **commercial lifetime license**  for using our product. You can do it by buying any of  **[premium themes](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes)**  or  **[Yclas Self-Hosted PRO](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/themes/yclas-self-hosted-pro.html)**. As a premium user you are allowed to delete license information.  [See the download options here](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html#package).

Premium themes are also free of publicity - if you donâ€™t want extra banners to appear at your site, please consider buying one of them!
