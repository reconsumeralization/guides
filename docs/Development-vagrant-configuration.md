### Instructions

1.  [Download](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)  and  [install](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)  Vagrant.
    
2.  [Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)  and install VirtualBox.
    
3.  Clone repo:
    
    ```
     git clone https://github.com/yclas/vagrant.git
    
     cd vagrant/
    
    ```
    
4.  Boot the environment:
    
    ```
     vagrant up
    
    ```
    
5.  To prove that it is running, you can SSH into the machine: (Optional).
    
    ```
     vagrant ssh
    
    ```
    
6.  Run: (if you have followed the step 5, type  _exit_  before the following command).
    
    ```
     sudo vim /etc/hosts
    
    ```
    
    and add those lines at the beggining of the file:
    
    ```
     192.168.50.4  reoc.lo
    
    ```
    
7.  Once the machine itâ€™s running, load this on your browser:
    
    ```
     http://reoc.lo/install-yclas.php
    
    ```
    
8.  To destroy the virtual machine and remove all traces of the guest machine from your system, run:
    
    ```
     vagrant destroy
    
    ```
    

Vagrant fails to remove temp files, so run this after vagrant destroy the virtual machine:

```
sudo rm -f d20* vagrant20*

```
