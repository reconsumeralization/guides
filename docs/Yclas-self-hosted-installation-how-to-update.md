# How to update your website?

Your website should be always up-to-date :)

You can find a guide for an **Automatic update** or **Manual update** below. We offer an **update service** as well.

Follow these simple steps and update to the newest version available.

**Requirments for updates**



 - 4.x version requires **PHP 7.3** as a minimal version.
 - Make sure that you have a **PHP 7** before updating. You can ask your hosting provider for it. This is necessary because you need to have a decent updated version of **PHP** installed for your hosting.
 - If you have Yclas Self-hosted Pro, be sure your susbscription is active so you get latest Pro version. [Please buy here](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html)
