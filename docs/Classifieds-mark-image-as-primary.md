# How to mark image as primary


Users have the option to change the **primary image** of their ad. If a user publishes an ad with five images, he can choose which image will be displayed as primary by editing the ad. 


## How it works

Let’s say you have published an ad with two images. This is how it is displayed on the listing page:

If you want to change the primary image,  click “Edit” on the ad then select **“Primary Image”**  the image you want to mark as primary.
