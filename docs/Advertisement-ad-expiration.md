## All ads expire after n days

This feature allows setting an expiration date to all published ads.

You can access this option by logging into your admin panel and going to **Settings** -> **Advertisement** -> **Publish Options** -> **Ad expiration date**.

And enter after how many days an ad should expire. If you enter 0 (zero) then the ads will never expire.


## Custom expiration date

This feature allows users to enter an expiration date on the publish new ad form.

Here are the steps you need to follow to give the sellers the option to choose an expiration date for their ads:

1.   Login to your **Admin Panel** ->  **Settings  -> Custom Fields**.
2.  Click  **New Field**.
3.  It’s essential to call the field  **expiresat**.
4.  In the Type input choose  **Date**.
5.  Click Create.

*Note: If you also set an “Ad expiration date” on your settings, then custom expiration date will always prevail.*
