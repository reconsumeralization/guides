# Auto-Data API ðŸš—

-   How it works

Auto-Data API can be used in a car dealer website, a marketplace, or any classifieds website where people can buy and sell cars.

It's a new and important feature because it lets the website owners and users publish and search for vehicles without maintaining and updating the vehicle information (**_Brand_,  _model_, and generation**).

## Configuration

1.  Login in to your **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **Configure** -> **Integrations** -> **Auto-Data API**  ->  **Enable Auto-Data**.
3.  Click  **Save**.

This action will enable  _Auto-Data-API_ and create all the required custom fields: Brand, model, generation.

> **Self-Hosted**
>
> On the Auto-Data API page, you also need to import the XML file provided from [Auto-Data API](https://api.auto-data.net).

## How it works

Now Auto-Data API is enabled, and the required fields are created. You, the car dealers/owners, or the person who publishes the car information will find three dropdown menus on the "publish new" page: "Brand", "Model" and "Generation". First, select a brand and then choose the model of the "Model" options.

1.  **Brand:** when you select a brand, the platform automatically retrieves the car brands and makes models available in the "Model" dropdown menu.
2.  **Make:** select the Brand to make all of its generations available in the "Generation" dropdown menu.
3.  **Model:** select the generation of the car.
