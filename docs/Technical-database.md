# Yclas database description

In the past, we worked on helping **developers** and **advanced users** to understand more on how the information is distributed in **Yclas** database and to give a better overall understanding of how **Yclas** works.

Basically, this is a detailed description of the database tables created during the installation of Yclas. Currently, the database supported by **Yclas** is **MySQL version 5.0** or greater.
