If you want your website users and visitors to be able to convert currencies then this is the widget for you. As the title says, this is the widget which users can use to choose between your selected currencies and have ads prices converted to their chosen currency.

## Get an API Key

This is a mandatory step to follow in order to have the currency converter widget work. What you need to do is to go to  [https://fixer.io/product](https://fixer.io/product)  and choose a plan. Once you choose the plan you will be redirected to create an account and you will find the API key  [here](https://fixer.io/dashboard).

If your website uses SSL, please note that  **SSL encryption**  is only allowed for  **Fixer**  paid plans.


## Create Currency Converter Widget

Itâ€™s really simple to create and use this widget:

1.  Login to your admin panel.
2.  Go to  **Design**  ->  **Widgets**.
3.  Find the Currency Converter Widget and press  **Create**.
4.  Choose  **where do you want the widget displayed**  and  **the name of the widget**  that will be displayed in your website.
5.  Type the  **Currencies to display**, comma separated, or leave it empty to display all the currencies.
6.  Enter the currency of your site on  **Choose the default currency**  field. Use this field ONLY in case you are using a different currency than your local one and make sure that the prices of the ads have the same currency.
7.  Click  **Save Changes**.
