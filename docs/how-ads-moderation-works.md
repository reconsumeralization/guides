# How Ads Moderation works?

## Ways to publish an Ad

Ads moderation can be a very important feature in case you want to control the amount of ads, their content or to manually avoid spammers. To configure ads moderation you can login to your **Admin Panel -> Settings -> General -> Moderation**.

# Post directly
Post directly is a way to allow users to post new advertisements without any validation later. This means that the administrator of the page will not have obligation to activate incoming ads.

EMAIL: After a user has created an advertisement, an email is sent to him. This email contains two links: one is to redirect him to his newly created ad; while the second one is to report if there’s an issue with his account.

# Moderation on
This option introduces limitation on publishing. Every new advertisement created is sent to moderation to be activated manually by administrator. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

EMAIL: One email is sent to user, notifying him of creation. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement edit. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.

# Payment on

Also known as **Pay to Post**.

You can make your users pay to publish an advertisement.

Go to Admin Panel and choose Settings > General.

In the field Moderation, choose the way ads will be published. To earn money you can choose Payment On - then whenever someone wants to post an ad on your page, he will be asked to pay. You can also choose Payment with moderation - users will pay to publish an ad. You will still have the possibility to moderate the ad before it becomes visible on your site.

You can also choose some categories where your users will have to pay to posting ads, while in others it will be for free. To do that, go to Panel > Settings > Categories, choose the ones that will need payment and hit Edit. In the last field of the form, write the price for posting in this category and click Submit. 

# Email confirmation on
This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. With this option every advertisement needs to be confirmed by the USER. It’s a standard way of confirming by email. The user receives an email, clicks on link that is provided and then this advertisement is validated and published. It will stay in moderation until then.

EMAIL: An email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement. NOTE: In case that this user has created advertisement while he was logged-out, after clicking the link, he will be signed up automatically.

# Email confirmation with moderation
This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. Here, the user needs to do the email activation and then the ad is sent to moderation to be validated by the admin. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then, it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

EMAIL: One email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement and then it will be placed in moderation until the admin activates it.

# Payment with Moderation
As in the case of “payment on”, the user is redirected to payment gateway only if the product has a fixed amount. Besides, this advertisement is also processed as a “Moderation on” case. In other words, if the payment is successful, the advertisement will be sent to moderation to be once again activated by the admin. But if the posting poroess wasn’t handled with a payment, this advertisement will be set in moderation and will be waiting for the admin to activate it.

EMAIL: One email is sent to user notifying him of the creation of a new ad. But, in this case, he has a link that redirects him to advertisement to edit it. He can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.
