# Logbee 🐝

 Integrate LogBee delivery services into your website in a few simple steps.
1. If you do not have an account with Logbee yet, please create one on Logbee's official website (https://www.logbee.com/). 
2. Login to your **Admin Panel**-> **Configure -> Integrations -> Social** and click on **Logbee**.
3. The next step is to install  **logmarklet**  or use a browser button for Chrome, ( soon on Forefox and Safari too!), which will later allow you to easily store your favorite ads into your Logbee account. Just drag the 'log it' button below onto your browser's bookmark bar.
