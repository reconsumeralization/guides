# Reasons for your license not to work

## Why my license isn't working?

Many users ask us this question after making a purchase, setting up the software and testing it. Then they would try to use the software on their domain and they get the  **error**: “_Please insert here the license for your theme.”_

What really happens is that the user makes a purchase of one Pro license, which comes with  **one license**  that can be used on only  **one domain**. So,  **one license = one domain** and can be used as many sub domains as you want. Then they would use that license on their localhost or on a test site just to see how the theme is working and when they try to get the theme working on their main website they face this issue.
