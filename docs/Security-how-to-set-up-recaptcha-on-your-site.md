**reCAPTCHA**  (yes, that’s how it’s spelled), is Google’s adaption to the CAPTCHA interface. CAPTCHA is an acronym which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. 
This free service is a computer program that is supposed to detect and distinguish automated input, generated by machines (website extraction scripts, spam bots, etc.) from humans.
