# How to Import Users

It’s much easier to import users instead of inserting them one by one.

## How to use it

Create a CSV file in utf8 with header (lower case): name email password image_1

**name:**  Name for user.
**email:**  Email address of user.
**password:**  Password of the user. Can be left empty and the system will generate a random password.
**subscriber:**  0 or 1 values. 1 if the user is subscribed to receive notification emails; o if not.

**Images:**

We allow to upload user profile images. Images allow remote images like  [http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/people/](http://lorempixel.com/1200/800/people/s)  or local, using as base your site root, for example /images/import/user1_pic1.png. The images will be downloaded, resized, thumbed, and deleted on completion.

**Custom Fields:**

Now it’s possible to import users with custom fields. All you need to do is to add the fields in the CSV file as headers, with the prefix  **cf_**. For example, if you have a custom field called “company” in your site, you need to include it in the CSV file headers as “cf_company”.
