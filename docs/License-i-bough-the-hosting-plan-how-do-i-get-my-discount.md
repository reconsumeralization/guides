# I bought the hosting plan, how do I get my discount?


  
We referred to this in many areas at our site, that if you  **[purchase a web hosting](https://yclas.com/self-hosted.html)**  from our  [referral link](https://yclas.com/hosting-pro), you are entitled to a PRO license no support.

So it is a very good deal!

**Once you do the purchase,  [contact us](https://yclas.com/contact/)  with the following information:**

-   The  **e-mail**  you are going to use for purchase
-   Your  **domain**
-   Your  **Order ID**, which you can find in your receipt

You can send the above information through the following contact page:

**[https://yclas.com/contact/](https://yclas.com/contact.html)**

Once you send us the information, we will provide you with the discount and guide you through the process, until your website is up and running.
