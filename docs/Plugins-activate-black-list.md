# How to activate black list and how it works?

The  **black list**  function  **blocks the users that published any ad you marked as spam**  from posting ever again. In simple words, you mark an ad as spam and the user who posted that ad can no longer post anything again.

**How to activate?**

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **Configure**  >  **Addons**.
3.  Find **Black list** and enable it by checking the box on the right. 
4. Click **Save**.

  Once you do that, whenever you mark an ad as spam you will receive an immediate  **warning message** in the same tab, saying that 
  the e-mail related to the user who published that ad is now blacklisted and prevented from posting.

To see a  **full list of blacklisted users**  follow those steps:

1.  Log in to your  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Go to  **Users** .
3.  To find a particular user, use the **Filter** to search users via **Status** or **Role**. For example, to find blacklisted users, use the following search criteria and press **Filter**:
