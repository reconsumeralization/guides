# Allowed email domains


This feature gives you the option to allow the registration of users that use a **specific domain** for their email address. 
For example, you can allow the registration of students using their university email address or users using an email address of an organization or company.

# How to use this feature?

To enable it, you need to go to  **Settings**  ->  **General**  and find the **"Allowed email domains"** field. In there, you need to write the email domains that you'd like to add for your users.

*Keep in mind that you need to push enter after each email domain name so that it's saved*.

If you want to allow **all the email domains** to be able to register on your site, just leave the field empty.
