# General Email Configuration

If you donâ€™t want to use your personal or administrator's email to get notifications for your website, or if you want to disable the notifications about new ads, you can follow this guide and change email your configuration.

You can access to these configurations by logging in to your **Admin Panel** ->   **Settings**  ->  **Email settings**.
-   **Notify email:**  This is the email address in which you will get notified for new ads. It will also be used for software communications.
-   **Notify name:**  The name that you will use to send the emails.
-   **Notify me on new ad:**  Enable this if you want to get notifications everytime there are new ads.
-   **Email Service:**  Email service enabled. SMTP or ElasticEmail services are highly recommended.
