Vehicle Data can be used in a car dealer website, a marketplace or any classifieds website where people can buy and sell cars. 

This is a new and important feature because it lets the owners of the websites and their users to list and search for vehicles without having to maintain and update the vehicle information (**_year_,  _model_  and make**).  Also, new cars and models will be automatically available.

4.  Click  **Create**.

This action will automatically enable  _CarQuery_  on Settings -> General -> CarQuery and create all the custom fields related to a car dealer website: forsaleby, adtype, year, make, model, othermake, kilometers, bodytype, transmission, drivetrain, color, fueltype and type.

## How it works

Now CarQuery is enabled and the required fields are created. You, the car dealers/owners or the person who publish the car information will find three dropdown menus in the “publish new” page: “Year”, “Make” and “Model”. First, select a year and then select the manufacturer from the “Make” options.

1.  **Year:**  when you select a year, the software automatically retrieves the car manufacturers of that year and makes them available in the “Make” dropdown menu.
2.  **Make:**  select the manufacturer to make all of its models available in the “Model” dropdown menu.
3.  **Model:**  select the model of the car.
