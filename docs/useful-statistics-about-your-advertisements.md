# Useful Statistics about your site and advertisements #


**Yclas** offers a variety of tools available in our classified software. Since our 2.6.0 version we have improved the statistics panel, displaying data that will be useful and valuable to you.

### Site Stats
**Site Statistics** are available in your **Admin Panel -> Stats**. You will be able to view the following: **number of ads**, **contact details**, **new users**, **paid orders**, **sales** and **visits** to your site.

### Advertisement Stats
*Yclas* provides comprehensive statistics about your advertisements. If you publish an ad you can see the stats for that ad, such as the number of contacts and visits as well as the overall statistics about your ads.

You can view this by logging in to your **Admin Panel** -> **Click Profile dropdown menu** -> **My Advertisements** -> **Click Stats**
