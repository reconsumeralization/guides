# How to change your site's name and description

When you  create a classifieds website with Yclas,  you can change your site's name and description very easily.

Both terms are pretty straight forward and self-explanatory. 

The site name carries the identity of your whole website and it is complimented by the description, which details your website‚Äôs purpose.

**Whenever you are editing these fields, make sure to:**

-   Check that the site name is the correct title of your website ‚Äì this will be publicly displayed online.
-   Check that your description matches your website‚Äôs content and purpose.
-   Take care and avoid grammatical errors, misleading/irrelevant input, plagiarism, etc.
-   Keep the length of the description field under the max (indicated by the tool tip ‚Äì 160 characters).
-   Add a few keywords in the description ‚Äì this could affect your SEO (Search Engine Optimization) analytics.

### How to change them step-by-step:

1.  Login to the  **Admin Panel**.
2.  Select  **Settings -> General**.
3.  Enter the site name into the input box labeled  **Site Name**.
4.  Enter the description into the input box labeled  **site description**.
5.  Click the  **Save**  button.

‚úî **The change is successful ‚Äì general configuration updated.**
