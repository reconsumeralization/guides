# Where to find my license number?

We prepared this guide after seeing many questions regarding the purchase process, so here are the simple steps you need to take to make a purchase and add it to your site:

1.  Go to  **[our market](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/)**  to  **choose a product** .
2.  Go through the  **payment process** .
3.  **Download**  the product . 
4.  **Check your e-mail**  (make sure it’s the  **same**  one you used when you registered) . 

You should receive  **two e-mails**  from us:

-   An email thanking you for your purchase.

-   Another email with the purchase receipt as indicated in the screenshots below.  **Please check the spam folder in your e-mail**  if you can’t find one of these emails.  

As you can see in those e-mails, the first one has your  **log in information**  for your portal here. And the second e-mail has your  **license number.**

Another way to get your license number is to log in to your panel  **[here](https://selfhosted.yclas.com/oc-panel/auth/login)**  and go to  **Purchases**, there you will find your license number (as indicated in the picture below).
