# Publish an add with a different contact email

## How to publish an ad with a different contact email?


Imagine that you publish an ad and there are some people who are interested in contacting another department within your company based on your add. They'll need a business email address.  

**Follow the steps:**
1.Create a new custom field for this specific purpose. 
If you don’t know how, you can follow [this guide](Custom-fields-create-custom-fields.md).

2. This custom field must be called  **contactemail**.
 If that field exists emails will be sent to that address instead of the user’s email address. 

3. After creating the custom field and saving it, it will be displayed for every category that you selected it for. It will be displayed among the other catogories when publishing a new ad. 

*You can add it as required field when creating it and it'll be displayed automatically each time a users selects the specific category.*
