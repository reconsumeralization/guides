# ADS Moderation 🔧

## Ways to publish an ad

Ads moderation is a very important feature when you want to control the amount of ads, their content or to manually avoid spammers. 
There are a few ways to moderte your ads and we are going to go through all of them:

 - Post Directly
 - Moderation On
 - Paymenet On
 - Email Confirmation On
 - Email Confirmation with Moderation On
 - Payment with Moderation

 
To configure Ads aoderation you need to go to your **Admin Panel -> Settings -> General -> Moderation**.

### Post directly

Post directly is a way to allow users to post new advertisements without any validation on a later stage. This means that the administrator of the page will not have any obligation to activate incoming ads.

_EMAIL:_ After a user has created an advertisement, an email is sent to them. This email contains **two links:** one is to redirect them to their newly created ad; while the second one is to report if there’s an issue with their account.

### Moderation on

This option introduces limitation on publishing. Every new advertisement created is sent to moderation to be activated manually by administrator. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to user, notifying them of the creation. But, in this case, they have a link that redirects them to advertisement edit. They can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.

### Payment on

When the payment is active, the user is redirected to a payment gateway. But not in every case. This happens only in cases in which the user have set fixed an amount of money that’s considered to be valid. Other ones are dealt like a case of “Post directly”. 
Example: the category “Rent a cat” have fixedan amount of 10 USD. After a user has set all the necessary fields and have clicked on button to post, they will be redirected to “Paypal”. Than they make the payment and, after this payment has been validated by “Paypal” and our back-office, thier advertisement is published with the current date and time. But if the category “Rent a car” doesn’t have an amount (amount of money = 0 ), the user’s advertisement will get published with a current date and time and set on top of the list.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent, that confirms that this advertisement is now active. Same as in “Post directly”.

### Email confirmation on

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. With this option every advertisement needs to be confirmed by the USER. It’s a standard way of confirming by email. The user receives an email, clicks on link that is provided and then this advertisement is validated and published. It will stay in moderation until then.

_EMAIL:_ An email is sent to the user with a link that will activate his new advertisement. NOTE: In case that this user has created advertisement while he was logged-out, after clicking the link, he will be signed up automatically.

### Email confirmation with moderation

This advertisement is set to “UNCONFIRMED”. Here, the user needs to do the email activation and then the ad is sent to moderation to be validated by the admin. This advertisement will be published with a date of activation. Until then, it can be found in admin panel under moderation.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to the user with a link that will activate their new advertisement and then it will be placed in moderation until the admin activates it.

### Payment with Moderation

As in the case of “payment on”, the user is redirected to payment gateway only if the product has a fixed amount. Besides, this advertisement is also processed as a “Moderation on” case. In other words, if the payment is successful, the advertisement will be sent to moderation to be once again activated by the admin. But if the posting poroess wasn’t handled with a payment, this advertisement will be set in moderation and will be waiting for the admin to activate it.

_EMAIL:_ One email is sent to the user notifying them of the creation of a new ad. However, in this case, they have a link that redirects them to the advertisement to edit it. They can modify this ad, but it won’t be published until the admin activates it.
