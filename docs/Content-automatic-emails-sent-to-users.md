**Tip:** Previously, when you wanted to replace the Email From field from all the email templates, you had to go to **Content** -> **Email** and edit all the templates one by one. Now thereâ€™s an option that allows you to change that field from all email templates directly.*

Follow these steps to set an email form: 
Go to  **Content**  ->  **Email** ->  **Set Email From**, set a new  _From Email_  and click  **Send**.
